    Hey Bub, 
  </h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I'm Sina.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I like to code <span title="sometimes we overclock🔥, sometimes we undervolt🔌">💻</span>, tinker <span title="imagine it🧬, build it🔬, use it🚀">🥼</span>, and be on the ice during a penalty kill <span title="🤺two-way🛡️ hockey brotha🤝">🏒</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I'm driven by a curiousity in various areas related to technology, music, 
    and art.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I like making things that I enjoy using and 
    love learning from creators/colleagues in the space.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-16 mb-4">thx, sina</p>
