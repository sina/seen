<p class="mb-8">Stick.ai was a platform for generating presentations and documents
  from user inputted text and suggested compatible template options. Real-time
  Natural Language Processing renders text in a compatible template with relevant 
  artwork and iconography. The generated presentation could be shared or exported
  to other platforms like Google Slides. In 2019 Google acquired Stick.ai via
  talent acquisition.</p>

<p>Established Docker environments with configuration as code that allowed all
  engineers to run the Stick.ai web application on Windows, OS X or Linux on day 1
  of employment. This allowed engineers to immediately interact with the codebase
  and work on features relevant to their area of expertise.</p>
