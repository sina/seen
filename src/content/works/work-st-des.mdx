<p class="mb-8">Stick.ai was a platform for generating presentations and documents
  from user inputted text and suggested compatible template options. Real-time
  Natural Language Processing renders text in a compatible template with relevant 
  artwork and iconography. The generated presentation could be shared or exported
  to other platforms like Google Slides. In 2019 Google acquired Stick.ai via
  talent acquisition.</p>

<p>Collaboration at a startup relies on moving from ideas to actions quickly
  and often. Using Trello boards/lists, Google Meet, Figma, AirTables and good ole'
  Post-It notes on our scrum wall, we refined designs, UX and features.</p>
