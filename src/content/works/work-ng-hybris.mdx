<p class="mb-8">Nasty Gal is an online apparel website specializing in affordable
  fast-fashion items for young women aged 16 - 30.</p>

<p>Migrated legacy ColdFusion e-commerce website to Sinatra, Ruby-based web
  application domain-specific-language, Java business-logic service layer
  and Hybris e-commerce platform. As an early adopter of Hybris before its
  acquisition by SAP, we scaled Nasty Gal to handle 10x transactions on
  high volume dates like Black Friday and Christmas week.</p>
