<p class="mb-8">Stick.ai was a platform for generating presentations and documents
  from user inputted text and suggested compatible template options. Real-time
  Natural Language Processing renders text in a compatible template with relevant 
  artwork and iconography. The generated presentation could be shared or exported
  to other platforms like Google Slides. In 2019 Google acquired Stick.ai via
  talent acquisition.</p>

<p> We quickly tested ideas using feature flags, Spring Boot, Node, React and
  MongoDB. Everything ran as containers in AWS using S3, ELB and Lambda instances as needed.</p>
