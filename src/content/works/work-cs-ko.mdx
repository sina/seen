<p class="mb-8">CoStar is a real estate platform with multiple web properties
  providing data, analytics, insights and commercial/residential rental/purchase
  listings for brokers, investors, lenders, tenants and buyers. Their properties
  include LoopNet, Apartments.com, CityFeet.com and Homes.com</p>

<p>Updated legacy CityFeet.com and LoopNet.com real estate listing portals to use
  responsive design architecture providing a mobile-first experience that was fast,
  readable and a replacement for native applications. By leveraging unified Java
  REST endpoints, intelligent lazy loading/caching and single page application architecture,
  consistent sub 300ms loads on standard mobile connections were achieved. C# webpages
  were seamlessly updated utilizing the Observable-pattern and two-way data binding
  features of Knockout js.</p>
