<p class="mb-8">CoStar is a real estate platform with multiple web properties
  providing data, analytics, insights and commercial/residential rental/purchase
  listings for brokers, investors, lenders, tenants and buyers. Their properties
  include LoopNet, Apartments.com, CityFeet.com and Homes.com</p>

<p>Using mockups created in Sketch and Figma web applications allowed exact
  matching of design mockups via exported css styling and image
  artifacts. This allowed product team vision and responsive interaction intents
  to be implemented in C#, CSS, HTML, and Javascript libraries with no guesswork
  or approximation.</p>
